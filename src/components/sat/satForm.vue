					<p>
						I've found absolutely NO resource as helpful as aimon. Thank you for
						giving me confidence. Thank you for helping me succeed. And thank
						you for being the means through which I bridge the gap between
						plateauing and succeeding. I went from scoring in the mid-1300s to a
						1460! I'm so glad I purchased your subscription!
					</p>
					<p>
						I got a perfect score...I knew I did really well but I never thought
						it would actually happen. Special shout out to aimon—their hard
						questions got me ready for that test. My hands are literally shaking
						as I type this out. My adrenaline is pumping like I just jumped out
						of a plane without a parachute!
					</p>
					<p>
						I swear, I did no other preparation than completing aimonand moved
						from a 1390 to a 1510 on the SAT. So, to all those prepping, I
						PROMISE you that, aimonIS THE REAL DEAL. Just finish all the
						questions and learn from your mistakes. IT'S FREAKING AMAZING!
