						After only a week’s use, I noticed that my score had improved by an
						entire point, so I continued to use the program. After about a
						month, I noticed that my score had improved drastically, and the
						amount of questions that I missed decreased. aimonis a great product
						for people looking for personalized studying, thorough explanations,
						and questions mirroring those on the ACT.
					</p>
					<p>
						aimonis a goldmine for practice problems. I found the problems
						slightly harder, and it helped me tremendously. aimonkind of reminds
						me of those donut things that baseball players put on their bats to
						make them more difficult to swing so that when they are actually at
						the plate swinging, it feels like a breeze.
					</p>
					<p>
						aimon helped me so much with every section of the exam. The
						explanations and challenging questions over-prepared me for the
						test, and it got me where I wanted to be.
